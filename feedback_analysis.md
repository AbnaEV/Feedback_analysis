# Machine Learning (ML) Report Summary-Feedback_Analysis
- The dataset encompasses feedback from students across various academic branches and is targeted at different resource persons.
- There is a representation of 4 unique branches and feedback has been recorded for 4 distinct resource persons.
- The distribution of data across faculty members is diverse, reflecting a wide range of feedback for individual sessions. This variety in responses can be instrumental in understanding the multifaceted aspects of teaching and learning experiences.

## Faculty-wise Distribution of Data

The dataset shows a distribution among four resource persons, with proportions as follows:
- Mrs. Akshara Sasidharan: 34.48%
- Mrs. Veena A Kumar: 31.03%
- Dr. Anju Pratap: 17.24%
- Mrs. Gayathri J L: 17.24%

Visualizations like bar graphs and pie charts effectively display this distribution, highlighting a concentration of sessions among a few faculty members.

## Summary of Responses
![Summary of responses](Images/2.jpg)
Boxplot visualizations reveal the spread and central tendency of ratings for various criteria (content quality, effectiveness, expertise, relevance, and overall organization), showing predominantly high ratings with median values often at or near 5. Outliers indicate sessions with significantly lower ratings.

### Content Quality

Generally high ratings, with outliers highlighting exceptional perceptions.

### Relevance
![Relevance](Images/6.jpg)
Scores are high, reflecting content applicability to real-world scenarios.

### Overall Organization
![Overall Organization](Images/7.jpg)
Well-received, with a few exceptions.

## Branch-wise Content Quality
![Branch-wise Content Quality](Images/8.jpg)
Boxplots show high content quality perceptions across all branches, with a wider spread in ratings for the RB and IMCA branches, indicating variability.

## Elbow Method and K-means Clustering

A scatter plot visualizes distinct groups based on Effectiveness and Expertise, indicating patterns that could predict student satisfaction levels.

## Content Quality Over Clusters
Crosstab analysis provides insights into content quality distribution across clusters, identifying variations in rating levels.

## Overall Insights

- The feedback is largely positive, with notable instances of lower ratings warranting further investigation.
- The session concentration among certain faculty suggests areas for specialization or preference exploration.
- High relevance ratings demonstrate strong industry alignment, a commendable aspect.
- Variations in content quality perception by branch suggest the need for tailored content or differing expectations.

## Recommendations

- **Investigate Outliers**: Follow-up on significantly divergent ratings to understand contributing factors.
- **Faculty Development**: Implement a program to share best practices, focusing on those with lower ratings or more variability.
- **Branch-specific Tailoring**: Analyze feedback for customized content or delivery methods in branches with wider rating spreads.
- **Leverage High Relevance**: Maintain and highlight the strong industry alignment as a course selling point.
- **Cluster-Driven Strategies**: Use clustering to tailor interventions or content to specific student feedback patterns.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly update the clustering analysis to adapt to changing student satisfaction trends.
- **Enhance Interactivity**: Increase interactive session elements to maintain engagement and satisfaction.
- **Benchmarking and Goals Setting**: Use current data as benchmarks for future sessions, with goals for maintaining high standards.

The data indicates a positive student experience with opportunities for targeted improvements, advocating a continuous improvement approach.
